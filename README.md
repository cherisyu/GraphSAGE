# Graphsage
Tensorflow implementation of ['Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs'](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs)   

## Introduction
A tensorflow implementation of graphsage, which is easier than the original implementation[GraphSAGE original implementation](https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE).   
This code includes supervised and uinsupervised version, and three types of aggregators('mean','pooling' and 'lstm').   

## Requirement
python 3.6, tensorflow 1.12.0   

## Results
Here shows accuracy of the supervised and unsupervised graphsage with 'mean' aggregator.
